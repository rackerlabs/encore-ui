/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name utilities.service:rxNotifyProperties
 * @description
 *
 * This factory provides functionality for abstracting "properties", and allowing
 * other directives/controllers/etc. to register for notifications when the properties
 * change. It would normally be used for a parent directive's controller, and child element
 * directives that "require" that controller.
 *
 * For example, say you have a value you want to track, which we'll call `numSelected`.
 * This will be a plain integer value that you have complete control over. What you want
 * is for other directives/controllers/etc to be able to register for notifications whenever
 * `numSelected` changes.
 *
 * The `registrationFn` method here sets all of this up. In your directive/controller where
 * you want your property to live, do something like:
 *
 * @example
 * <pre>
 * stats = { _numSelected: 0 };
 * scope.registerForNumSelected = rxNotifyProperties.registrationFn(stats, 'numSelected', '_numSelected');
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is saying "We have a property `_numSelected` in `stats`, and we want it exposed as `numSelected`
 * in `stats`. Whenever `stats.numSelected` is modified, other directives/controllers should be notified."
 *
 * In this example, a user registers for notifications by calling:
 * <pre>
 * registerForNumSelected(notificationFunction);
 * </pre>
 * Then, whenever `numSelected` changes, it will call:
 * <pre>
 * notificationFunction(newValue, oldValue);
 * </pre>
 *
 * This means that if you set:
 * <pre>
 * stats.numSelected = 20;
 * </pre>
 * Everyone that registered for notifications will get their notification function called.
