/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name utilities.service:rxSelectFilter
 * @description
 * A prototype for creating objects that can be used for filtering arrays.
 *
 * ## rxSelectFilter
 * This service exposes an object with single method, `create()`, used to
 * create instances of a `rxSelectFilter`. It is configurable via three options:
 * - `properties`: A list of the properties to create a filter control.
 * Assuming the source data is an array of objects, a property is equivalent to
 * an object's key.
 *
 * - `available` (optional): An object that tracks which options are available
 * for a property.
 * Note that the key of the object matches a value in the `properties` array.
 * - `selected` (optional): An object that tracks which options are selected
 * for a property. It has the same form as the `available` object, but the
 * arrays indicate which options are selected, and as such are strict subsets
 * of their `available` counterparts.
 *
 * ### Option Defaults
 * Every property that is listed in `properties` but not provided as a key
 * to `available` will be automatically populated the first time `applyTo()`
 * (see below) is called.
 * <pre>
 * var filter = rxSelectFilter.create({
 *   properties: ['year']
 * });
 *
 * filter.applyTo([{
 *   eventId: 1,
 *   year: 2013
 * }, {
 *   eventId: 2,
 *   year: 2014
 * }, {
 *   eventId: 3,
 *   year: 2013
 * }]);
 * // filter.available is { year: [2013, 2014] }
 * </pre>
 * **Note:** There is an implied requirement that, when relying on the
 * auto-populated filter, the input array will have at least one item for every
 * available option. For example, this may not be the case when used with
 * server-side pagination.
 *
 * Every property that is listed in `properties` but not provided as a key to
 * `selected` is initialized to have all options selected (by looking them up
 * in `available`).  If property is also not provided to `available`, its
 * initialization is delayed until the first call of `applyTo()`.
 *
 * <pre>
 * var filter = rxSelectFilter.create({
 *   properties: ['year'],
 *   available: {
 *       year: [2013, 2014, 2015]
 *   }
 * });
 * // filter.selected is { year: [2013, 2014, 2015] }
 * </pre>
 *
 * ### Instances
 * Instances of `rxSelectFilter` have an `applyTo()` method, which applies the
 * filter's internal state of selected options to the array. This will not
 * often be called directly, but instead used by the
 * {@link utilities.filter:rxApply rxApply} filter. As stated previously,
 * the first call of `applyTo()` will initialize any
 * `properties` that have not been defined in `available` or `selected`.
 * <pre>
 * var filter = rxSelectFilter.create({
 *   properties: ['year'],
 *   selected: {
 *      year: [2014]
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * var filteredArray = filter.applyTo([{
 *   eventId: 1,
 *   year: 2013
 * }, {
 *   eventId: 2,
 *   year: 2014
 * }, {
 *   eventId: 3,
 *   year: 2013
 * }]);
 * // filteredArray is [{ eventId: 2, year: 2014 }]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The instance will also have all of the constructor options as public
 * properties, so that they can be watched or changed.
