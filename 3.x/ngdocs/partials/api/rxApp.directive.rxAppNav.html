<h3 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure">Navigation Menu JSON Structure</h3>
<p>EncoreUI applications, by default, load the navigation menu from JSON defined
in the <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui-nav">encore-ui-nav project</a>.
You can specify that a different JSON file be used (see the demo below), but
a certain structure is expected for the JSON.</p>
<h4 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_outer-structure/sections">Outer structure/Sections</h4>
<p>The JSON consists of an array of objects, with each object representing a
&quot;section&quot; in the nav. The two demos at the bottom of this page each only have
one section, <code>&quot;All Tools&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Example Menu&quot;</code>, respectively. As such, the
JSON for each of them is an array with one object in it. The default EncoreUI
nav menu only has one section <code>&quot;All Tools&quot;</code>, and individual products should
not be expecting to add their own sections.</p>
<p>The application that this documentation lives in has three sections, which you
can see if you look at the current left nav menu.
They are <code>EncoreUI</code>, <code>Design Styleguide</code> and <code>All Components</code>.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_outer-structure/sections"><code>title</code> (required)</h5>
<p>Each section specified in this array is required to have a <code>title</code>
attribute, i.e.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
navJSON = [
    {
        "title": "Section 1"
    }, {
        "title": "Section 2"
    }
]
</pre>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_outer-structure/sections"><code>type</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>Each section can optionally have a <code>type</code> attribute. If present, a class with
the value <code>nav-section-TYPE</code> will be applied in the nav, otherwise
<code>nav-section-all</code> will be applied.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
navJSON = [
    {
        "title": "Section 1",
        "type": "highlight"
    }, {
        "title": "Section 2"
    }
]
</pre>
<p>In this example, <code>Section 1</code> will have a <code>nav-section-highlight</code> class applied
to it, while <code>Section 2</code> will receive the default <code>nav-section-all</code> class.</p>
<p>The default Encore nav menu does not currently use the <code>type</code> property, and
products being added to Encore should avoid it. This attribute is reserved
for future use by the EncoreUI designers.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_outer-structure/sections"><code>children</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>A section&#39;s <code>children</code> attribute details the first level of navigation items
that live within the section. This is defined as an array of objects, where
each object represents an &quot;item&quot; to be displayed in the nav (and the structure
of the objects/items themselves will be defined in the Navigation Items
section below). As an example, this could look like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
navJSON = [
    {
        "title": "Section 1",
        "type": "highlight",
        "children": [
            {
                "href": "/overview",
                "key": "overview",
                "linkText": "Overview"
            }, {
                "href": "/about",
                "key": "about",
                "linkText": "About"
            },
        ]
    }, {
        "title": "Section 2",
        "children": [
            {
                "href": "/overview2",
                "linkText": "Section 2 Overview"
            }
        ]
    }
]
</pre>
<p>These <code>children</code> will be able to have further <code>children</code> nested inside them,
accessible via an expand/collapse chevron, but it is important to note that
the top level <code>children</code> in each section will <em>always</em> be displayed.</p>
<h4 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items">Navigation Items</h4>
<p>A Navigation Item is an object that exists in a <code>children</code> array, and
represents a clickable item. These items have many optional attributes,
and can themselves contain <code>children</code> attributes.</p>
<p>Their only required attribute is <code>linkText</code>. The object will also need <em>one</em>
of the <code>href</code> or <code>children</code> attributes, but these two should be mutually exclusive.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>linkText</code> (required)</h5>
<p>The <code>linkText</code> attribute defines what text will be shown for the item in the
nav menu. This was shown in the example above,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
       "title": "Section 1",
       "type": "highlight",
       "children": [
           {
                "href": "/overview",
                "key": "overview",
                "linkText": "Overview"
          }, {
                "href": "/about",
                "key": "about",
                "linkText": "About"
          },
      ]
}
</pre>
<p>These items will be displayed in the nav with <code>Overview</code> and <code>About</code> text.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>key</code> (required for top-level items)</h5>
<p>The <code>key</code> attribute is used to provide an unique identifier for individual
navigation items. If you are introducing a new top-level item into the nav
menu, then the <code>key</code> is required. It is optional for any nested items. There
are two possible reasons you would want to provide this for nested items:</p>
<ol>
<li>A nav item with a <code>key</code> will have the class <code>rx-app-key-{{ item.key }}</code>
applied to it</li>
<li><code>rxAppRoutes</code> exposes a few methods for working with the key, including
<code>isActiveByKey()</code> and <code>setRouteByKey()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, you should not need to provide a <code>key</code> attribute for any nested
children. We try to avoid custom styling inside the nav, so the automatic
class application shouldn&#39;t be necessary. And the <code>rxAppRoutes</code> methods are
<em>generally</em> only used internally by EncoreUI.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>href</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>The <code>href</code> attribute is used to assign a URL to the item, which will be
navigated to when clicked. If the item has a <code>children</code> attribute, you
normally would not include <code>href</code>, because you want the children to
expand/collapse when this item is clicked, rather than navigating away to
somewhere else.</p>
<p>For Encore products within Rackspace, we keep the products on the same domain
(encore.rackspace.com), but give each product its own top-level path, i.e.
<code>encore.rackspace.com/foo</code>, <code>encore.rackspace.com/bar</code>. By doing this, the
<code>href</code> values can simply be entered as <code>/foo</code> and <code>/bar</code>. And more importantly,
<code>/foo</code> and <code>/bar</code> can be <em>completely separate Angular applications</em>. Both
applications are available in the nav, but clicking on <code>/foo</code> will load a new
Angular application, while clicking on <code>/bar</code> loads a brand new Angular
application.</p>
<p>This allows applications to be developed and deployed independently from each
other. The nav is aware of all the applications, but they do not have to be
aware of each other.</p>
<p>An extra feature of <code>href</code> is that you can put variables into it, that will be
interpolated with the current <code>$route.current.pathParams</code>. Thus, you can do
something like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
     "title": "Section 1",
    "type": "highlight",
    "children": [
        {
            "href": "/overview",
            "key": "overview",
            "linkText": "Overview"
        }, {
            "href": "/about/{{foobar}}",
            "key": "about",
            "linkText": "About"
        },
        ]
}
</pre>
<p>If <code>foobar</code> is currently in <code>$route.current.pathParams</code>, then its value will
automatically be inserted into the final URL.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>children</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>If an item doesn&#39;t have an <code>href</code> attribute, it&#39;s probably because it has
child items via the <code>children</code> attribute.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
     "title": "Section 1",
    "type": "highlight",
    "children": [
        {
            "href": "/overview",
            "key": "overview",
            "linkText": "Overview"
        }, {
            "href": "/about",
            "key": "about",
            "linkText": "About"
        }, {
            "linkText": "People",
            "children": [
                {
                    "href": "/people/bob",
                    "linkText": "Bob",
                }, {
                    "href": "/people/sue",
                    "linkText": "Sue"
                }

            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>This example shows a new item <code>People</code>, which has no <code>href</code> of its own, but
does have <code>children</code>, which contains two new items, each with their own unique <code>href</code>.</p>
<p>By default, the <code>Bob</code> and <code>Sue</code> items will not be visible, and in the nav,
<code>People</code> will automatically have a chevron attached. When clicked, it will
expand to show the <code>children</code> items.</p>
<p>As an aside, in this example, there will likely be one Angular application at
<code>/people</code>, which is resonsible for routing <code>/people/bob</code> and <code>/people/sue</code>,
while <code>/overview</code> and <code>/about</code> would probably be two different Angular
applications.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>visibility</code> and <code>childVisibility</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>The <code>visibility</code> attribute is used to control whether or not an individual nav
item is visible to the user. If <code>visibility</code> is not specified, then by default
the item is always visible. The <code>childVisibility</code> attribute takes all the same
possible values as <code>visibility</code>, but is used to determine whether the items in
<code>children</code> should be visible.</p>
<p><code>visibility</code> can take a few types of values. The original form used in EncoreUI
was to pass an expression, filtering values with <code>rxEnvironmentMatch</code>, i.e.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
"visibility": "('unified-preprod' | rxEnvironmentMatch) || ('local' | rxEnvironmentMatch)",
</pre>
<p>This expression would be evaluated, checking if the user is currently viewing
the app in the <code>unified-preprod</code> environment or the <code>local</code> environment, and
only display the item if one of those was true. (See <a href="#/api/utilities.service:rxEnvironment">rxEnvironment</a>
for more details on environemnts). This was used to prevent items from being
displayed in a production environment if they were only currently available in
staging.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Using an expression for environment checking use has somewhat tailed off.
We now have different JSON files for each environment, so checking the current
environment is not necessary.</p>
<p>Another technique for visibility is to use a predefined set of visibility
functions that exist in the framework—<code>rxPathParams</code>, for example.</p>
<p>To use these, you pass an array to <code>visibility</code>, with the first argument being
the name of the function to use (as a string), and the second argument as an
optional object describing the parameters to pass to the function.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>rxPathParams</code> is used to check if a particular parameter is
present in the current route. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
"visibility": ["rxPathParams", { "param": "accountNumber" }],
</pre>
<p>This means &quot;only show this item if <code>accountNumber</code> is present in the current route.</p>
<p><code>rxPathParams</code> is typically used with <code>childVisibility</code>, not <code>visibility</code>. For
instance, the <code>Account</code> section in Encore will by default show a search directive
(discussed later), and none of its children are visible. After entering a search
term, an account number is found, and inserted into the route. At that point,
all of the children under <code>Account</code> will be visible, as they all require an
<code>accountNumber</code> to correctly operate.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>childHeader</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>The <code>childHeader</code> attribute is used to specify an HTML header to be placed
above the <code>children</code> in an expanded area (and thus having a <code>childHeader</code>
attribute requires having a <code>children</code> attribute).</p>
<p><code>childHeader</code> receives HTML content as a string, and uses
<a href="#/api/utilities.directive:rxCompile">utilities.directive:rxCompile</a> to compile and insert the content above
the <code>children</code> items. The compiled content will be linked against the current
scope, allowing you to do things like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "title": "Section 1",
    "type": "highlight",
    "childHeader": "&lt;strong&gt;Current Account:&lt;/strong&gt;#{{route.current.pathParams.accountNumber}}",
    "children": [
        {
            "href": "/overview",
            "key": "overview",
            "linkText": "Overview"
        }, {
            "href": "/about",
            "key": "about",
            "linkText": "About"
        }, {
           "linkText": "People",
           "children": [
                {
                    "href": "/people/bob",
                    "linkText": "Bob"
                }, {
                    "href": "/people/sue",
                    "linkText": "Sue"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>This example will pull the <code>accountNumber</code> from the <code>pathParams</code>, and insert
<code>Current Account: 1234</code> above the children.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>roles</code> (optional)</h5>
<p><em>Note</em>: Support for <code>roles</code> requires at least version 1.19.0 of EncoreUI.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>visibility</code> criteria described above, you can also restrict
which items are shown to a user based on the LDAP roles of that user. This is
done via the <code>roles</code> attribute, which takes a single object as its value. This
object can be used to specify that a user requires <em>all</em> roles from a certain
set, or <em>any</em> role from a certain set, to see an item. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "title": "Section 1",
    "type": "highlight",
    "childHeader": "&lt;strong&gt;Current Account:&lt;/strong&gt;#{{route.current.pathParams.accountNumber}}",
    "children": [
        {
            "href": "/overview",
            "key": "overview",
            "linkText": "Overview"
        }, {
            "href": "/about",
            "key": "about",
            "linkText": "About"
        }, {
            "linkText": "People",
            "children": [
                {
                    "href": "/people/bob",
                    "linkText": "Bob",
                    "roles": { "all": ["role1", "role2"] }
                }, {
                    "href": "/people/sue",
                    "linkText": "Sue",
                    "roles": { "any": ["role1", "role2", "role3"] }
                }

            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>Bob</code> item can only be seen by users who have <em>both</em> <code>role1</code>
and <code>role2</code> in their LDAP roles, while the <code>Sue</code> item can only be seen by users
who have <em>at least one</em> of <code>role1</code>, <code>role2</code>, or <code>role3</code>. Please keep in mind that you
<a href="https://goo.gl/wzuhxO">can&#39;t do real security in front-end JavaScript</a>.
Do not rely on <code>roles</code> as a security feature. <code>roles</code> is purely to enhance user
experience, to prevent them from seeing items that they won&#39;t have permissions
to access anyway. All the data is still sent to the browser. A user who knows
how to use the dev tools will be able to see the full list. LDAP role-based
security must still happen on the server-side.</p>
<h5 id="description_navigation-menu-json-structure_navigation-items"><code>directive</code> (optional)</h5>
<p>The optional <code>directive</code> attribute receives the name of a directive in its
dash-delimited format (i.e. uses <code>&quot;rx-account-search&quot;</code> instead of <code>&quot;rxAccountSearch&quot;</code>).
If this directive is available, then the navigation menu will have that directive
inserted and rendered directly under the <code>linkText</code> for the nav item.</p>
<p>The most important line in the previous paragraph is <code>If this directive is
available...</code>. Let&#39;s say we add a new <code>Support</code> item to the nav, where each
of its children are supposed to render its own custom search directive:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "linkText": "Support",
    "children": [
        {
            "linkText": "People Support",
            "directive": "people-search"
        }, {
            "linkText": "Machine Support",
            "directive": "machine-search"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>The <em>intent</em> is that when the user clicks on &quot;Support&quot;, the menu will expand
to show &quot;People Support&quot; and &quot;Machine Support&quot; child items, and each will
contain a search box, defined by the <code>people-search</code> and <code>machine-search</code>
directives, respectively.</p>
<p>But where do those directives come from? <code>rxApp</code> provides some legacy
directives that are available to the nav, including <code>rxAppSearch</code>,
<code>rxAccountUsers</code>, etc. But <code>people-search</code> does not come from <code>rxApp</code>. And
recall from the <code>href</code> section that the nav might be defining multiple
different Angular applications. What if &quot;Support&quot; is defined in your
application, ad that&#39;s where <code>people-search</code> comes from, but the user is
currently in a different application? That different application won&#39;t have
<code>people-search</code> defined anywhere, so when the user clicks on &quot;Support&quot;, the
directives won&#39;t be available.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to ensure that these elements with directives <em>also</em>
have an <code>href</code>, and those URLs belong to Angular applications that define those
directives. i.e.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{
    "linkText": "Support",
    "key": "support",
    "children": [
        {
            "linkText": "People Support",
            "directive": "people-search",
            "href": "/support/people-support",
        }, {
            "linkText": "Machine Support",
            "directive": "machine-search",
            "href": "/support/machine-support",
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
<p>In fact, recall that we said all items <em>must</em> have one of <code>href</code> or <code>children</code>,
so the <code>href</code> is necessary anyway. But they key here is that by having an <code>href</code>,
the browser will navigate to <code>/support/people-support</code> / <code>/support/machine-support</code>,
which should be defined in Angular apps that have <code>people-search</code> and <code>machine-search</code>
available as directives.</p>
<p>With this configuration, clicking on <code>Support</code> will expand the <code>children</code>,
and the user will see <code>People Support</code> and <code>Machine Support</code>, but they will
not see the directives. But if they then click on one of <code>People Support</code> or
<code>Machine Support</code>, then the <code>/support</code> Angular application will be loaded,
the and the directives will become available.</p>
